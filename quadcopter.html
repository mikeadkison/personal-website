          <h2>Quadcopters</h2>
          <p>
            Several years ago I my first quadcopter - a Walkera Hoten-X. It measured about 400mm diagonally, which is pretty big for a first quadcopter. The company that makes it is based in Hong Kong. The charger it came with sucked, so it only flew for about 15 seconds. I bought a different charger and it was able to fly for about 8 minutes, which is pretty standard for a quadcopter. When I first tried to fly it, I was barely able to hover it, let alone fly it around.

           After I got better a flying, I eventually strapped a video recorder to the quad(which it could barely lift as its motors were pretty weak) with duct tape to record some shaky aerial footage. I loved being able to see things from the air, and around the same time FPV (first person view) camera systems were becoming widely available. These systems consist of a tiny camera and a video transmitter, which are strapped to the quadcopter, and a receiver connected to some sort of video monitor (a screen or video goggles) on the ground. My first quadcopter was starting to get pretty beat up, so I constructed a new quadcopter of about the same size, using a wood and plastic kit from <a href="http://flitetest.com/articles/knuckle-h-quad" target="_blank" class="main-link">Flite Test</a> for the frame, and electronics from <a href="http://hobbyking.com" target="_blank" class="main-link">HobbyKing</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
     Some time later, I added a small camera and video transmitter to the frame, and bought fat shark video goggles which have a built in video receiver. With those additions, I was able to fly my quadcopter in first person, as if I was sitting on it. This remains my favorite way to fly. Eventually, I added a 2-axis gimbal underneath the camera which allowed the camera to mimic my head movements. When I looked left or right while wearing the video goggles, the sensors in goggles picked up my movements and they were transmitted to the quadcopter to move the camera in the same manner that my head moved. I was able to literally look around while flying.
         </p>

           During my first internship after my freshman year, I built another quadcopter, this time the frame that I bought was made of Delrin, some sort of plastic. I cannibalized my wooden quadcopter's electronics for the new one, except for the motors which were new and more powerful. This new frame had a wooden mount that was isolated from the vibration of the frame, which stopped motor vibration from showing up in the video feed.
